[{"content":"Introduction API stands for Application Programming Interface. API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and intergrating application software. This interface allows different software programs to interact with each other by calling functions, passing data and accessing different capabilities.\nTypes of APIs The main types are:\nREST APIs - REST(Representational State Transfer) This is a common architecture style. They typically provide CRUD(create, Read,Update, Delete) operations and use HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Data is uasually returned in JSON or XML format. SOAP APIs - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is an older style of web service API that uses XML for messaging. SOAP APIs are more rigid than REST and require more bandwidth. GraphQL APIs - GraphQL is a newer API standard that allows clients to specify exactly what data they need in a query. It can be more efficient than REST for fetching specific fields. Webhook APIs - Webhooks allow apps to provide other applications with real-time information via callbacks. The receiving app registers a webhook which triggers an event on a certain action. Async APIs - Async APIs use message queues to enable asynchronous communication between apps. The app publishes a message rather than directly calling another app. Streaming APIs - Streaming APIs give clients a continuous stream of data in real-time. This is useful for apps like live video streaming. Microservices APIs - Microservices break down an app into small modular services with their own APIs. This allows for more flexible and scalable development as services can be independently maintained and updated. Lab This lab is based on Build your first CRUD API in 45 minutes or less! from AWS Workshops.\n_Prerequisites _\nDynamoDB for Data Storage: It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it a reliable choice for storing and retrieving data in serverless applications. Lambda for Serverless Compute: It can be triggered by various events, such as HTTP requests from API Gateway, making it ideal for building serverless APIs. API Gateway for Endpoint Management: It integrates with Lambda functions, enabling you to define API endpoints that trigger serverless functions to process incoming requests. Cloud9 for Development Environment: It allows developers to write, test, and debug code directly in the cloud. Step 1: Setting up DynamoDB Setting up a DynamoDB table named \u0026ldquo;http-crud-tutorial-items\u0026rdquo; with a primary key \u0026ldquo;id.\u0026rdquo; DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS, offering scalability, performance, and reliability for handling structured data. Create a DyanmoDB table\nStep 2: Creating a Lambda Function Next, we create a Lambda function named \u0026ldquo;http-crud-tutorial-function\u0026rdquo; that interacts with DynamoDB to perform CRUD operations. The Lambda function is written in Node.js 14.x and uses the AWS SDK to communicate with DynamoDB. It handles HTTP requests from API Gateway and executes corresponding operations on the DynamoDB table. Create a Lambda funtion and insert the code in the index.js\nconst AWS = require(\u0026#34;aws-sdk\u0026#34;);\rconst dynamo = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();\rexports.handler = async (event, context) =\u0026gt; {\rlet body;\rlet statusCode = 200;\rconst headers = {\r\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;\r};\rtry {\rswitch (event.routeKey) {\rcase \u0026#34;DELETE /items/{id}\u0026#34;:\rawait dynamo\r.delete({\rTableName: \u0026#34;http-crud-tutorial-items\u0026#34;,\rKey: {\rid: event.pathParameters.id\r}\r})\r.promise();\rbody = `Deleted item ${event.pathParameters.id}`;\rbreak;\rcase \u0026#34;GET /items/{id}\u0026#34;:\rbody = await dynamo\r.get({\rTableName: \u0026#34;http-crud-tutorial-items\u0026#34;,\rKey: {\rid: event.pathParameters.id\r}\r})\r.promise();\rbreak;\rcase \u0026#34;GET /items\u0026#34;:\rbody = await dynamo.scan({ TableName: \u0026#34;http-crud-tutorial-items\u0026#34; }).promise();\rbreak;\rcase \u0026#34;PUT /items\u0026#34;:\rlet requestJSON = JSON.parse(event.body);\rawait dynamo\r.put({\rTableName: \u0026#34;http-crud-tutorial-items\u0026#34;,\rItem: {\rid: requestJSON.id,\rprice: requestJSON.price,\rname: requestJSON.name\r}\r})\r.promise();\rbody = `Put item ${requestJSON.id}`;\rbreak;\rdefault:\rthrow new Error(`Unsupported route: \u0026#34;${event.routeKey}\u0026#34;`);\r}\r} catch (err) {\rstatusCode = 400;\rbody = err.message;\r} finally {\rbody = JSON.stringify(body);\r}\rreturn {\rstatusCode,\rbody,\rheaders\r};\r}; Step 3: Configuring API Gateway We then configure a HTTP API using API Gateway to expose our Lambda function as RESTful endpoints. We create routes for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods to perform CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.\nCreate a HTTP API\nchoose GET the path, enter /items/{id} choose GET the path, enter /items choose PUT the path, enter /items choose DELETE the path, enter /items/{id} Integration type, choose Lambda function, enter http-crud-tutorial-function Step 4: Testing the API With our API set up, we use tools like CURL to test our endpoints. Fisrt we invoke the url, one can locate it from stages in your api details. Replace URL INVOKE_URL=\u0026quot;https://**abcdef123**.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\u0026quot;\rcurl -X \u0026#34;PUT\u0026#34; -H \u0026#34;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#34; -d \u0026#34;{\r\\\u0026#34;id\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;abcdef234\\\u0026#34;,\r\\\u0026#34;price\\\u0026#34;: 12345,\r\\\u0026#34;name\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;myitem\\\u0026#34;\r}\u0026#34; $INVOKE_URL/items Add a many items as possible Test CRUD FUNTIONS Step 5: Conclusion In conclusion, building a simple CRUD API with AWS services empowers developers to create scalable and efficient solutions for managing data. By leveraging DynamoDB for storage, Lambda for serverless compute, API Gateway for endpoint management, and Cloud9 IDE for development and testing, we\u0026rsquo;ve demonstrated a streamlined approach to API development on AWS.\n","permalink":"https://manassehmwangi.devatlas.org/blog/post4/crud/","summary":"Introduction API stands for Application Programming Interface.

Cloud Quest features 12 real-life scenario assignments which prepare and train you to become an AWS Cloud Practitioner at absolutely no cost. This free game targets audiences that are new to Cloud Computing and people who want to learn the basics of Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nAWS Cloud Quest Essentials Topics Link to the game on Skill Builder AWS Skill Builder The 12 real-life scenario assignment labs include:\nHighly Available Web Applications Networking Concepts File Systems in the Cloud Core Security Concepts Cloud Computing Essentials Connecting VPCs First NoSQL Database Cloud Economics Databases in Practice Auto-Healing and Scaling Architecture Computing Solutions Cloud First Steps DNS Analyzing Network Traffic Single-Page App Container Services Decoupling Applications Auto-Healing and Scaling Applications Resource Monitoring Content Delivery Networks Backing up Data Deploying RESTful APIs Serverless Foundations API with Database Automation with CloudFormation Resource Governance In the next sections I\u0026rsquo;ll cover 4 main areas in terms of interface and world (it is a game after all), content and quests (how does the knowledge align with the game), user interaction and performance (how does the system and environment perform) and learning experience (how effective is it in teaching cloud concepts and practice). Followed by an overall summary of the review and recommendation compared to some other AWS free education programs.\nWhen you come to the Solution Center to build the solution and complete the quest, you have 4 steps you need to go through:\nLearn Plan Practice DIY 1: Learn In the learn section you can interact with a diagram of the solution you build and can watch videos of the concepts and services that you will use. I must admit, the diagram was really helpful and gets new to cloud learners used to the concept of solution or architecture diagrams as well as explain what the services are and the way they function. The less great part of this step was the factt that at times the videos took long to load, therefore give it time for the videos to load then watch them. They help one understand the services in the lab and give insights. I highly recommend you watch them even though there might be a glitch or a lag. 2: Plan In the plan section you will use the architecture diagram to creatively come up with the solution for the challenge. It displays the practice lab goals in which this section gives the steps to follow to achieve the goal and the DIY goals where one does this section using the knowledge gained. 3: Practice This is the interactive hands-on area. Here, you will get to implement an initial solution using the actual AWS Management Console itself. It will provide you with an AWS Console session that will expire in 2 hours and 30 minutes. Just as the name of this section implies, this part is mainly for practicing the steps for the final solution that you will implement in the next section. Once you click open AWS console button a new tab will open and you will be directed to the AWS Management Consol homepage. When you are through with the hands on section, this image will be dipslayed showing you\u0026rsquo;ve finished the section.
